-  Conceptualizing the modeling process
  - We are comfortable talking about models loosely, but how do we go from a plain-English description to an explicit, technical formulation?
    -  Start by describing as we'd normally do so, e.g.:
      -  "Households share information with other households."
    -  Look for nouns and verbs.
      -  " **Households** â€¦ other **households**."
        - NOUN: SUBJECT, OBJECT
        - Households are a type of agent.
        - Some interaction space between them
      -  " **share** information"
        - VERB
        - Households have the capacity to share
      -  "share **information**"
        - NOUN: OBJECT
        - What they share is "information"
        - Households must "have" some information
    -  As we talk through these descriptions, we can start to identify elements of the conceptualization below.
  - Model Framework
    -  Model Parameters/Configuration
      -  Initial conditions
        - Spatial configuration
        - Population/agents
      -  Thresholds
      -  Distributional assumptions/configurations
    -  Actors/Agents
      -  Types of Agents
      -  Agents
        - Properties
        - Methods
    -  Environment/Space
      -  Types of Space
        - "Physical", "Spatial"
          -  Lines, grids, torii, 3D
          -  Shapefiles and GIS models
        - Network/interaction
      -  Constrains/guides interactions between agents
      -  Affects the "state" or "capability" of agents
